                                <h3>FRP Electrical Box – A Smart & Safe Choice for Farmers</h3>
                            </li>
                            <p>In today’s time, electricity has become a basic need for farming. From water pumps and
                                motors
                                to lighting and control panels, electrical systems are used everywhere in agricultural
                                fields. But along with electricity, <strong>safety has become a big concern,
                                </strong>especially in rural
                                and
                                outdoor areas.</p>
                            <p>For many years, <strong>metal electrical boxes </strong>have been commonly used in farms.
                                Unfortunately,
                                these
                                metal boxes have also become the reason for many serious accidents. During rain,
                                moisture,
                                or water leakage, metal boxes can easily carry electric current. Because of this,
                                <strong>many
                                    farmers and workers have lost their lives due to electric shock.</strong></p>
                            <p>Understanding this serious problem, we have developed a <strong>special FRP Electrical
                                    Box,</strong>
                                designed
                                especially for farmers and outdoor use. This product is created with one clear goal —
                                <strong>maximum safety with long-term durability.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                <h3>The Problem with Metal Electrical Boxes</h3>
                            </li>
                            <p>Metal electrical boxes may look strong, but in real outdoor conditions, they are risky.
                            </p>
                            <ul class="ul1">
                                <li>Metal conducts electricity</li>
                                <li>Water and moisture increase shock risk</li>
                                <li>Rust and corrosion weaken the box</li>
                                <li>Poor insulation leads to short circuits</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>In farming areas, water is everywhere — irrigation, rain, wet soil, humidity, and open
                                fields. When water enters a metal box or touches its surface, <strong>the chances of
                                    electric
                                    shock
                                    increase dangerously.</strong>
                                This is not just a technical issue, it is a <strong>life-threatening problem.</strong>
                            </p>
                            <li>
                                <h3>Our Solution – FRP Electrical Box</h3>
                            </li>
                            <p>To solve this issue, we converted the traditional metal electrical box into a
                                <strong>modern FRP
                                    Electrical Box.</strong>
                                FRP stands for <strong>Fiber Reinforced Plastic,</strong> a material known for its
                                <strong>non-conductive,
                                    waterproof, and heat-resistant properties.</strong> Unlike metal, FRP does not allow
                                electricity
                                to pass through the body.
                                Even if there is moisture or water around, <strong>FRP remains electrically
                                    safe.</strong></p>
                            <li>
                                <h3>99.9% Shock-Free Safety</h3>
                            </li>
                            <p>The biggest advantage of our FRP Electrical Box is safety.</p>
                            <ul class="ul1">
                                <li>FRP is a <strong>non-conductive material</strong></li>
                                <li>It does not carry electric current</li>
                                <li>Chances of electric shock are reduced by <strong>up to 99.9%</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This makes it a much safer option compared to metal boxes, especially in farms, pump
                                houses, and outdoor electrical installations.</p>
                            <p>For farmers, this means:</p>
                            <ul class="ul1 ul2">
                                <li>Less risk while operating pumps</li>
                                <li>Safer maintenance work</li>
                                <li>Protection for workers and family members</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>
                                <h3>99.9% Waterproof – Perfect for Outdoor Use</h3>
                            </li>
                            <p>Farming and water go hand in hand. That is why electrical equipment must be able to
                                handle wet conditions.</p>
                            <ul class="ul1">
                                <li>Safe during heavy rain</li>
                                <li>Suitable for irrigation areas</li>
                                <li>No damage due to moisture</li>
                                <li>Internal wiring stays protected</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Water cannot enter easily, and even if the surroundings are wet, the box continues to
                                perform safely.</p>
                            <li>
                                <h3>No Rust, No Corrosion, Long Life</h3>
                            </li>
                            <p>One of the biggest problems with metal boxes is <strong>rust.</strong></p>
                            <p>Over time:</p>
                            <ul class="ul1">
                                <li>Rust damages the box</li>
                                <li>Screws become weak</li>
                                <li>Doors stop closing properly</li>
                                <li>Safety reduces day by day</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>FRP completely solves this issue.</p>
                            <ul class="ul1">
                                <li>No rust</li>
                                <li>No corrosion</li>
